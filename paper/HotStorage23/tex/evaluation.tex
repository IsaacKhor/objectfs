\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

Our ObFS prototype is a FUSE file system implemented in roughly 2000 lines of C++.
It performs garbage collection and checkpointing, but does not yet implement snapshots, clone, overlays, or partial checkpoints.
We have verified its functionality against a local S3 object store\footnote{Based on Ceph Rados Gateway (RGW).}, but do not yet have performance results.
