High-level FUSE interface passes all HW3 tests. Things to consider doing now:

- connect to FUSE and actually try it
- re-target to low-level FUSE interface?
- test driver for low-level FUSE interface
- ?? round header to even block size? is that at all useful?
- S3 storage backend

The data path was the easy part - next comes adding metadata persistence.

- for first metadata write, all data is in memory, just write it out
- simple strategy:
  - read all metadata not in memory
  - write all metadata
  - drop all metadata? 


-- not done yet...
